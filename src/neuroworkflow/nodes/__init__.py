"""
Pre-built node implementations for the NeuroWorkflow system.

This package provides a collection of ready-to-use nodes for various tasks.

Each node is self-contained and should be imported directly from its module,

For example:
    from neuroworkflow.nodes.network.TVBVisualizationNode import TVBVisualizationNode
    from neuroworkflow.nodes.simulation.TVBSimulatorNode import TVBSimulatorNode
