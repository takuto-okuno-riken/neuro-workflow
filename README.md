# NeuroWorkflow

A Python library for building and executing neural simulation workflows.

## Features

- Node-based workflow system for neural simulations
- Type-safe connections between workflow components
- Pre-built nodes for common neural simulation tasks
- Extensible architecture for custom nodes

## Current status

- the folder scr contains the nodes (sample classes)
- in the examples folder, at this time, I only checked the functionality of the file simple_simulation.py (I am checking the other examples I will confirm their functionality in the coming days).
- in the notebooks folder, at this time, I only checked the functionality of the file 01_Basic_Simulation.ipynb (I am checking the other examples I will confirm their functionality in the coming days).
